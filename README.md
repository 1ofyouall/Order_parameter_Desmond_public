# Order_parameter_Desmond_public
Simple Order parameter calculation of Molecular systems from Desmond Maestro .csv out files. Here you can see calculations for molecular system containing separate chromophore molecules with a dipole moment. You can modify it as you wish.

P2 parameter - gives you the same graph Maestro can plot right in GUI.

Order_parameter_av - gives you calculated average order parameter for all chromophores during simulation.

Order_parameter_av_reverse_sign_cos3 - taking into account the direction of the chromophore by Cos sign changing (what Desmond program does not take into account).
